# Exercise 18: Volume of a Cylinder

'''
The volume of a cylinder can be computed by multiplying the area of its circular
base by its height. Write a program that reads the radius of the cylinder, along with
its height, from the user and computes its volume. Display the result rounded to one
decimal place

from math import *

def computeVolumeOfCylender(radius, height):
    # Formula to find volume of cylender: Ï€ * r^2 * h
      
    volume_of_cylender = pi * (radius **2) * height

    return volume_of_cylender


input_radius = float(input("Enter the radius of cylender: "))
input_height = float(input("Enter the height of cylender: "))

cylender_volmue = computeVolumeOfCylender(input_radius, input_height)
print(f"Volume of Cylender is: {round(cylender_volmue, 1)}")
